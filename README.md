# Pre-Lay Survey of Project Panther Flexible Pipelines  
**Project Locations:** OKAN GGCP to Delta S. PP, SOWIP to Delta Jkt 17, Okan GGCP to Delta PP  
**Date:** April 2024  
**Role:** Lead Surveyor  
**Client:** Chevron Nigeria Limited  
**Vessel:** MC CELTIC ZION  

## Responsibilities  
- Collaborated with the project client and Project Manager to define the survey scope, objectives, and deliverables.  
- Ensured all survey equipment was calibrated, tested, and ready for deployment.  
- Organized and briefed the survey team, assigning specific tasks and responsibilities.  
- Utilized C-Nav DGPS and TSS Meridian Gyro for accurate positioning and navigation during the survey, ensuring all sensors received accurate output.  
- Conducted detailed seabed mapping using a single beam echosounder (Echotrac) to gather depth information.  
- Deployed the side scan sonar to capture high-resolution images of the seabed, identifying potential obstacles and features.  
- Used the Magnetometer (G882) to detect ferrous objects and potential pipeline routes.  
- Employed the sub-bottom profiler (Edgetech) to investigate subsurface conditions and detect buried objects or sediments.  
- Oversaw survey operations in real time, using EIVA NaviPac to monitor data collection and ensure alignment with project objectives.  
- Continuously assessed data quality, making real-time adjustments to survey equipment and methodologies as needed.
